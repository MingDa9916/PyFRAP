Fit now saves final equalization factors.

Model selection methods now also return number of parameters fitted.

Moved old way of computing equalization factors into pyfrp_fit_module.findMinEquFacts. 

Equalization factors are now an additional parameter to be fitted. For this, made major changes to:
- pyfrp_fit_module.equalize: Now takes equFacts as argument, only computes equFacts the old way if
  asked to.
- pyfrp_fit_module.assignInputVariables: Can now handle equFacts as input.
- pyfrp_fit_module.checkInput: Can now handle equFacts as input.
- pyfrp_optimization_module.constrObjFunc: Now adjust to handle equFacts as input.
- pyfrp_optimization_module.buildBoundLists: New function to build lists of boundaries 
  for transforming x into constrained form.
- pyfrp_fit.fit: Now has new attributes LBEqu/UBEqu
- pyfrp_fit.fit.addROI: Adjusts x0 with equFacts automatically.
- pyfrp_fit.fit.removeROI: Adjusts x0 with equFacts automatically.
- pyfrp_fit.fit.getX0: Builds equFacts into x0.
- pyfrp_fit.fit.getBounds: Builds equFacts boundaries into bounds.
- pyfrp_fit.fit.reset2DefaultX0: Builds x0 in standard way.
- pyfrp_fit.fit: Added set/get methods for everything equFact related.

New IO functions to handle tables:
- pyfrp_term_module.printTable: Print table in nice way.
- pyfrp_IO_module.writeTableToCSV: Writes table to csv file in nice way.
