Temporary openscad path export/setup.py fix

Added temporarily path management also for openscad.
Now users do not need to set the openscad PATH environment
variable anymore, but PyFRAP rather sets the variable when 
it needs it during the session.

Fixed bugs in setup.py: Now path to Gmsh executable is set 
properly for Windows install.

TODO:
	
	- Data structure:
		- We might want to move away from saving to pickle files. IDEA: 
			- molecule files do not save anymore list of embryos but just list of path to embryo files.
			- whenever embryo is needed, molecule calls getEmbryo and thus loading file. This also happens
			  user clicks on gui on embryo
			- Could also include a loadAll option. 
	- GUI integration:
		- mesh merging
		- Simulation visualization
		- Geometry visualization
		- Multiple plotting functions
		- Embryo slicing
		- Simulation to image export
		- In general when plot command is called, ask if plotting should be done in current axis.
		- Add plot modifier from PyFDAP
		- Add additional plotting functions
		- Move all plotting functionalities in GUI to Plotting MB
		- In showObjPropsInBar, if array is longer than maxLength, write sth like "array/list of shape"
		- Get embryo/molecule compression saving running again.
		- Include 2D geometries, e.g. allow dim setting for custom geometries.
	- Might be faster in analysis if we load all files at first, put them in common numpy array, apply all image manupulation steps
	  and finally grab ROIs via c=imgs[idxs,:]
	- pyfrp_gmsh_geometry.ruledSurface should store more than a single lineLoop but rather have a lineLoops list.
	- Need to add pyfrp_gmsh_geometry.planeSurface class.
	- Speed-up via trillionos
	- simulation.showIC via vtk
	- In GUI, when selecting fnFlatten, we need to make sure that we add slash
		
Additions:
	- Added pyfrp_openscad_module.addOpenscadToPATHs.
