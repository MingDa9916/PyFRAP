pyplot backend fix for OSX/bugfix in conf


Fixed bug in pyfrp_conf.configuration. 
shutil.copy does not like it when src
and dst file are the same. However, if the
path to the pathfile doesn't change, this is
the case. Needed exception to fix that.

Added matplotlib backend check in __init__.py
for each module. In newer OSX versions, there 
seems to be a problem for python versions that 
are not installed as framework. This causes 
pyplot imports to crash. PyFRAP now checks 
on import if OS is OSX and sets backend to qt4agg,
which should always work since PyFRAP relies on qt4.

TODO:
	
	- Data structure:
		- We might want to move away from saving to pickle files. IDEA: 
			- molecule files do not save anymore list of embryos but just list of path to embryo files.
			- whenever embryo is needed, molecule calls getEmbryo and thus loading file. This also happens
			  user clicks on gui on embryo
			- Could also include a loadAll option. 
	- GUI integration:
		- mesh merging
		- Simulation visualization
		- Geometry visualization
		- Multiple plotting functions
		- Embryo slicing
		- Simulation to image export
		- In general when plot command is called, ask if plotting should be done in current axis.
		- Add plot modifier from PyFDAP
		- Add additional plotting functions
		- Move all plotting functionalities in GUI to Plotting MB
		- In showObjPropsInBar, if array is longer than maxLength, write sth like "array/list of shape"
		- Get embryo/molecule compression saving running again.
		- Include 2D geometries, e.g. allow dim setting for custom geometries.
	- Might be faster in analysis if we load all files at first, put them in common numpy array, apply all image manupulation steps
	  and finally grab ROIs via c=imgs[idxs,:]
	- pyfrp_gmsh_geometry.ruledSurface should store more than a single lineLoop but rather have a lineLoops list.
	- Need to add pyfrp_gmsh_geometry.planeSurface class.
	- Speed-up via trillionos
	- simulation.showIC via vtk
	- In GUI, when selecting fnFlatten, we need to make sure that we add slash
